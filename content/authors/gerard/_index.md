## My Research

Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Columbia Universityâ€™s Data Science Institute, and I will join the Sociology Department at Columbia University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2020. My research draws from the literature on urban sociology, stratification, and criminology, and it focuses on understanding how the spatial  organization of the American stratification system creates and reproduces inequalities.

My current research agenda investigates (1) how the neighborhood context, particularly the experience of community violence, determines the life chances of children; (2) how social capital and social organization emerge and evolve in spatial contexts; and (3) how place and geography structure educational and economic opportunity in America and elsewhere.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in the American Sociological Review, Child Development, Demography, Housing Policy Debate, the Journal of Housing Economics, the Journal of Urban Economics, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
